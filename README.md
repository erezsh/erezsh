👋 Welcome to my Github profile! Have a look at my open-source projects:
- [Lark](https://github.com/lark-parser/lark), an innovative parsing toolkit, that's grown to be the most popular parser in the Python ecosystem!
- [Reladiff](https://github.com/erezsh/reladiff), a tool for high-performance diffing of large datasets across databases.
- [Preql](https://github.com/erezsh/Preql), an ambitious new programming language that compiles to SQL. (inactive, but I plan to resume working on it some day!)
- [Runtype](https://github.com/erezsh/runtype), a collection of run-time type utilities including validation and multiple dispatch. 
- Many more!

👩‍💻 My stack is Python for everything, and Svelte+Typescript for webdev. I also write in C++, Rust, Julia, and many others.

🌎 I'm living the life of a digital nomad; I spend a lot of my time in Amsterdam.

👅 I speak Hebrew, English and un poquito de Spanish.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate! Let me know if you have a cool project in mind, or want to help with one of mine. I'm especially interested in programming languages, the semantic-web, machine learning, static analysis, and recommendation systems.

👷‍♂️ I am a freelancer, and may be available for hire for cool and interesting projects, either open-source and proprietry.
