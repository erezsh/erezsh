👋 Welcome to my Github profile! Have a look at my open-source projects:
- [Lark](https://github.com/lark-parser/lark), an innovative parsing toolkit, that's grown to be the most popular parser in the Python ecosystem!
- [Data-diff](https://github.com/datafold/data-diff), a tool for cross-database diffing, that generously funded by [Datafold](https://github.com/datafold/).
- [Preql](https://github.com/erezsh/Preql), an ambitious new programming language that compiles to SQL. (inactive, but I plan to resume working on it soon!)
- [Runtype](https://github.com/erezsh/runtype), a collection of run-time type utilities including validation and multiple dispatch. 
- Many more!

👩‍💻 My stack is Python for everything, and Svelte for webdev. But I have experience with many others.

🌎 I'm living the life of a digital nomad; I spend a lot of my time in Amsterdam.

👅 I speak Hebrew, English and some Spanish.

🎮 I play Chess, and dabble in Rocket League and Starcraft (Remastered).

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate! Let me know if you have a cool project in mind, or want to help with one of mine. I'm especially interested in programming languages, the semantic-web, machine learning, static analysis, and recommendation systems.

👷‍♂️ I am a freelancer, and may be available for hire for cool and interesting projects, both open-source and proprietry.
